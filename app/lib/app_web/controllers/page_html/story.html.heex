  Our Story
</h1>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Our story, like so many of the modern age, began on the dating app Hinge.
  Cozied up with family over the holidays of 2021
  vented to her sisters: "I'm only meeting people of low quality and I don't know
  why!" she exclaimed. Susan and Karen, always there to
  be Helen's guiding compass, took a look at her profile; they were apalled by what
  they found.
</p>
<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  "No wonder you're only matching with miscreants. A profile like this is no
  good!" You've got to fully represent yourself and put the energy out
  there that you want to find, a nerdy, athletic, honest person." They decalred.
  Unable to tolerate the mess before them, Susan and Karen joined forces, and
  together with the power of sisterhood they channeled their lifelong knowledge
  and love of Helen's essence to perform a Cinderellian transformation of
  Helen's Hinge profile.
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Naught but a few days later, Helen, on Saturday January 8th at 2:21 AM liked
  the profile of a cute a dashing young nerd named Adam. Our first conversation
  went like this:
</p>

<.conversation messages={
  build_conversation([
    %{adam?: true, indicator?: true, text: "Hey, how are you liking SF?"},
    %{adam?: false, indicator?: false, text: "Hi I love it, it's so beautiful"},
    %{
      adam?: false,
      indicator?: true,
      text: "I went on a hike to Alamere falls today it was gorgeous"
    },
    %{
      adam?: true,
      indicator?: true,
      text:
        "Oh I love that hike. I did it with a friend and we had trouble finding the waterfall and almost turned around before it"
    },
    %{
      adam?: false,
      indicator?: true,
      text: "Did you post a photo with a caption about chasing waterfalls?"
    },
    %{adam?: true, indicator?: false, text: "hahaha no missed opportunity there"},
    %{adam?: true, indicator?: false, text: "Did you?"},
    %{
      adam?: true,
      indicator?: true,
      text: "I'm also a minority in that I don't have an instagram"
    },
    %{
      adam?: false,
      indicator?: true,
      text: "No but I wondered how many people had"
    },
    %{adam?: true, indicator?: false, text: "Yeah it's too cheesy of a caption to not be used"},
    %{adam?: true, indicator?: true, text: "So what brought you to SF?"},
    %{adam?: false, indicator?: true, text: "Cool startup"}
  ])
} />

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  It was at this point in our Story that Adam thought to himself.
  <i>
    Did she really just respond, "Cool startup"?! I can't do anything with
    this. Well what do I have to lose... on one hand this conversation is going
    nowhere, on the other hand she's cute and I'm not doing anything
    tomorrow. Time to shoot my shot.
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  And shoot his shot he did.
</p>

<.conversation messages={
  build_conversation([
    %{
      adam?: true,
      indicator?: true,
      text:
        "Cool lol. Well you've officially pass my rigorous \"probably not a serial killer test\". Are you doing anything tomorrow night? Would you want to get a drink at noc noc? It's a cool wine bar in lower haight."
    },
    %{
      adam?: false,
      indicator?: true,
      text:
        "Hahaha wow I passed?? Yay! Tomorrow's trivia night but I could stop by beforehand, like 6?"
    },
    %{
      adam?: true,
      indicator?: false,
      text: "Wow just moved here and already a regular at trivia night. I impressed ðŸ¤“"
    },
    %{
      adam?: true,
      indicator?: true,
      text: "6 works for me. See you tomorrow :)"
    }
  ])
} />

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  It was at this point in our Story that Helen thought to herself.
  <i>Huh I am not impressed with that typo, but maybe be with someone less detailed
    oriented than myself... And besides I already committed to a date.</i>
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  The date was set and the next night, Adam sent a quick check-in.
</p>

<.conversation messages={
  build_conversation([
    %{
      adam?: true,
      indicator?: true,
      text:
        "Hey just confirming that we're still on for noc noc in an hour. I'm not always the best at checking hinge. Here's my number if anything comes up (847)555-1234"
    },
    %{
      adam?: false,
      indicator?: true,
      text: "Ya I'm about to bike that way"
    }
  ])
} />

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Being a man of quality, Adam arrived at Noc Noc at a punctual 5:45pm. After
  sitting in the bar alone for a bit, Adam thought it was odd that he hadn't
  heard from or seen Helen yet...
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Meanwhile, across town, Helen was lost pedaling her way up San
  Francisco's notorious hills in an unfamiliar part of the city. Due to her
  lack of navigational excellence (<i>a trait she would come to deeply
  appreciate in her life partner</i>), Helen had fallen significantly behind
  Google Maps' predicted arrival time.
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  However, Adam didn't know any of this and was sitting alone in a bar with
  nothing but his thought &mdash; contemplating whether or not Helen was going to
  show up. Unsure what to do, he sent a quick messsage.
</p>

<.conversation messages={
  build_conversation([
    %{adam?: true, indicator?: true, text: "Hey everything ok?"}
  ])
} />

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  No response. So, approximately 15 minutes past the hour, Adam thought
  <i>well I guess the girl from the "cool startup" isn't showing up. It was a
    long shot anyway, time to go home.</i>
  He stood up to leave. As he was striding out,
  Adam spotted a vaguely familiar blonde walking with a bicycle;
  "Helen?" he queried.
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  "Adam?" Helen responded "Were you leaving?"
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  "Can I help you with your bike? How was your day?" Adam asked as he gave his
  most charming smile, hoping to smooth over the that he was leaving.
</p>
<p>
  "It was good but I got lost on the way over!" said Helen, who was immediately
  impressed with his bright smile. Adam then helped Helen guide her bike into a
  safe corner of the quiet bar, they ordered a drink, and the rest

    is history...

</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Over the coming years Helen and Adam's love would grow with every adventure.
  Whether it was making skiing at Kirkwood,
  traveling across Asia, or playing video games in their beloved San Francisco
  apartment, there were most happy and fully themselves in each other's company.
  In the coming years they'd come to create some of the best memories
  of their young lives as they prepared to move to Chicago and start the next
  chapter; together.

    For those from San Francisco, Adam was confused

    is not a wine bar.
