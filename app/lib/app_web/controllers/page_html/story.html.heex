  Our Story
</h1>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Our story, like so many of the modern age, began on the dating app Hinge.
  While enjoying the holidays with her family, Helen vented to her
  sisters: "I'm only meeting people of low quality and I don't know why!"
  Susan and Karen, always there to be Helen's guiding compass, took
  a look at her profile and were apalled by what they found.
</p>
<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  "No wonder you're only matching with miscreants. A profile like this is no
  good! You've got to accurately display yourself and put the energy out
  there that you want to find &mdash; a nerdy, active, honest person."
  Unable to tolerate the mess of misrepresentation before them, Susan and Karen joined forces.
  Together they channeled the power of sisterhood and their lifelong love of Helen's essence to perform a Cinderellian transformation of
  Helen's Hinge profile.
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Naught but a few days later, Helen liked
  the profile of a dashing young nerd named Adam. Our first conversation
  went like this:

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  It was at this point in our Story that Adam thought to himself.
  <i>
    Did she really just respond, "Cool startup"?! This conversation is going
    nowhere, but she is cute and I'm not doing anything
    tomorrow... Time to shoot my shot.
  </i>
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  And shoot his shot he did.
</p>

<.conversation messages={

      adam?: true,
      indicator?: true,
      text:
        "Cool lol. Well you've officially pass my rigorous \"probably not a serial killer test\". Are you doing anything tomorrow night? Would you want to get a drink at noc noc? It's a cool wine bar in lower haight."
    }
  ])
} />

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  It was at this point in our Story that Helen thought to herself.
  <i>"Pass"?! Well he clearly doesn't proofread his texts... Maybe I'll just
    schedule a hard cutoff in case the date goes south.</i>
</p>

<.conversation messages={

    %{
      adam?: false,

      text: "6 works for me. See you tomorrow :)"
    }

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  The date was set, and the next night Adam sent a quick check-in.
</p>

<.conversation messages={

    %{
      type: :date,
      date: "Mon, Jan 11,",
      time: "5:01 PM"

    %{
      adam?: true,
      indicator?: true,
      text:
        "Hey just confirming that we're still on for noc noc in an hour. I'm not always the best at checking hinge. Here's my number if anything comes up (847)555-1234"

    %{
      adam?: false,
      indicator?: true,
      text: "Ya I'm about to bike that way"
    }
  ])
} />

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Being a man of quality, Adam arrived at Noc Noc at a punctual 5:45pm. After
  sitting in the bar alone for a bit, Adam thought it was odd that he hadn't
  heard from or seen Helen yet...
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Meanwhile across town, Helen was huffing and puffing her way up San
  Francisco's notorious hills in an unfamiliar part of the city. Due to her
  lack of navigational excellence (a trait she would come to deeply
  appreciate in her life partner), Helen had fallen significantly behind the
  Google Maps ETA.
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Adam continued to sit alone in the bar. He contemplated whether or not the
  girl Helen was going to show up and unsure what to do, he sent a quick
  messsage.
</p>

<.conversation messages={
  build_conversation([
    %{adam?: true, indicator?: true, text: "Hey everything ok?"}
  ])
} />

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  No response. At approximately 15 minutes past the hour, Adam called it quits.
  <i>Well I guess the girl from the "cool startup" isn't showing up. It was a
    long shot anyway.</i>
  He thought as he stood up to leave. Striding out of the bar,
  Adam locked eyes with a vaguely familiar blonde haired woman.
  She was walking towards him
  with a bicycle by her side; "Helen?" he queried.
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  "Adam?" Helen responded "Were you leaving?"
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  "Can I help you with your bike? How was your day?" Adam asked flashing his
  most charming smile.
</p>
<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  "It was good!" Helen exclaimed, as both of our anxieties dissipated. Adam
  helped Helen guide her bike into a safe corner of the quiet bar, they ordered
  a drink, and the rest

    is history...
  </.link>
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Over the coming years Helen and Adam's love would grow with every adventure.
  They would experience everything from the excitement of skiing The Wall at Kirkwood and traveling
  across Asia, to the simple joys of playing video games in their beloved San
  Francisco apartment. These next few years would hold the best memories of
  their young lives, and forge the foundation of their
  relationship.
