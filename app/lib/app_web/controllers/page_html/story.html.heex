  Our Story
</h1>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Our story, like so many of the modern age, began on the dating app Hinge.
  Over the holidays of 2021, Helen, irked by her troubles on the apps,
  was vented to her sisters. "I'm only meeting boys of low quality and I don't know
  why!" she probably exclaimed. In response, Susan and Karen, always there to
  be Helen's guiding compass, reviewed her profile; only to be appalled by what
  they found.
</p>
<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  "No wonder you're only matching with miscreants. A profile like this is no
  good." They may have responded. Unable to tolerate the mess that laid before
  them, they joined forces, and together with the power of sisterhood they
  channeled their lifelong knowledge and love of Helen's essence to perform a
  Cinderellian tranformation of Helen's Hinge profile. It was not but a few
  days later that Helen would match with a cute boy named Adam (<i>maybe at
  midnight</i>).
</p>
<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Our first conversation went like this:
</p>

<.conversation messages={[
  %{adam?: true, indicator?: true, text: "Hey how was your weekend?"},
  %{adam?: false, indicator?: false, text: "It was good"},
  %{
    adam?: false,
    indicator?: true,
    text: "I went on a hike to Alamere falls today it was gorgeous"
  },
  %{
    adam?: true,
    indicator?: true,
    text:
      "Oh I love that hike. I did it with a friend and we had trouble finding the waterfall and almost turned around before it"
  },
  %{
    adam?: false,
    indicator?: true,
    text: "Did you post a photo with a caption about chasing waterfalls?"
  },
  %{adam?: true, indicator?: false, text: "hahaha no missed opportunity there"},
  %{adam?: true, indicator?: false, text: "Did you?"},
  %{
    adam?: true,
    indicator?: true,
    text: "I'm also a minority in that I don't have an instagram"
  },
  %{
    adam?: false,
    indicator?: true,
    text: "No but I wondered how many people had"
  },
  %{adam?: true, indicator?: false, text: "Yeah it's too cheesy of a caption to not be used"},
  %{adam?: true, indicator?: true, text: "So what brought you to SF?"},
  %{adam?: false, indicator?: true, text: "Cool startup"}
]} />

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  It was at this point in our Story that Adam thought to himself.
  <i>
    Did she really just respond, "Cool startup"!? I can't do anything with
    this. Well what do I have to lose... on one hand this conversation is going
    nowhere, on the other hand she's cute and I'm not doing anything
    tomorrow. Time to shoot my shot.
  </i>
  And shoot his shot he did.
</p>

<.conversation messages={[
  %{
    adam?: true,
    indicator?: true,
    text:
      "Cool lol. Well you've officially pass my rigorous \"probably not a serial killer test\". Are you doing anything tomorrow night? Would you want to get a drink at noc noc? It's a cool wine bar in lower haight."
  }
]} />

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  It was at this point in our Story that Helen thought to herself.
  <i>Wow his grammar is terrible. However, not being on instagram is a
    green flag and I have some free time tomorrow before trivia.</i>
</p>

<.conversation messages={[
  %{
    adam?: false,
    indicator?: true,
    text:
      "Hahaha wow I passed?? Yay! Tomorrow's trivia night but I could stop by beforehand, like 6?"
  },
  %{
    adam?: true,
    indicator?: false,
    text: "Wow just moved here and already a regular at trivia night. I impressed ðŸ¤“"
  },
  %{
    adam?: true,
    indicator?: true,
    text: "6 works for me. See you tomorrow :)"
  }
]} />
<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  The date was set and the next night, Adam sent a quick check-in.
</p>

<.conversation messages={[
  %{
    adam?: true,
    indicator?: true,
    text:
      "Hey just confirming that we're still on for noc noc in an hour. I'm not always the best at checking hinge. Here's my number if anything comes up (847)555-1234"
  },
  %{
    adam?: false,
    indicator?: true,
    text: "Ya I'm about to bike that way"
  }
]} />

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Being a man of quality, Adam arrived at Noc Noc at a punctual 5:45pm. After
  sitting in the bar alone for a bit, Adam thought it was odd that he hadn't
  heard from or seen Helen yet...
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Meanwhile, across town, Helen was lost cycling through up San Francisco's
  notroious hills through an unfamiliar part of the city. Due to her lack of
  navigational excellence, Helen had fallen significantly behind Google Maps'
  predicted arrival time.
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  However, Adam didn't know this and was sitting alone in a bar with nothing
  but his thought to contemplating whether or not Helen was going to show up.
  Unsure what to do, he sent a quick messsage.
</p>

<.conversation messages={[
  %{adam?: true, indicator?: true, text: "Hey everything ok?"}
]} />

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  No response. So, approximately 15 minutes passed the hour, Adam thought
  <i>well I guess the girl from the "cool startup" isn't showing up. It was a
    long shot anyway, time to go home.</i>
  He stood up and he walked out of the bar. As he was striding out.
  Adam spotted a cute vaguely familiar looking blonde walking with a bicycle;
  "Helen?" he quieried.
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  "Adam?" Helen responsed "were you leaving?"
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  "Can I help you with your bike? How was your day?" Adam asked as he tried to
  smoothy cover the fact that he was in the midst of leaving. Adam then helped
  Helen guide her bike into a visible corner of the quiet bar, they ordered a
  drink, and the rest

    is history...

</p>

<p class="mt-4 mb-4">
  Over the coming years Helen and Adam's love would grow with every adventure.
  Whether it was making gingerbread houses for Christmas, skiing at Kirkwood,
  traveling across Asia, or playing video games in their beloved San Franciso
  apartment. In the coming years they'd come to create some the best memories
  of their young lives as they prepared to move to Chicago and start the next
  chapter; together.
